abstract = {With the development of deep learning methods and their wide application in medical image segmentation tasks, mammography, used for early breast cancer screening, can further assist clinicians in diagnosis to a certain extent. Due to the loss of fine-grained features in the downsampling process and the very few available mammograms, the main methods for extracting masses from the whole mammography are relatively ineffective. In this paper, we propose a novel mass segmentation model for mammograms based on two U-Net network models, and integrate the Receptive Field Block (RFB) module in-between to enhance the deep features captured by the model. We augmented the input image using Segment Anything Model (SAM) and evaluated the proposed architecture on two public datasets, namely the Curated Breast Imaging Subset of Digital Database for Screening Mammography (CBIS-DDSM) and INBreast, as well as on a private dataset. The results show that the proposed model for segmenting masses in ROI regions can achieve high Dice scores of 92.18\% and 89.85\%, and Intersection over Union (IoU) scores of 85.47\% and 80.80\% on both INBreast and the private dataset. In addition, our model for segmenting masses on whole mammographs in CBIS-DDSM dataset can achieve Dice scores of 58.10\% and 41.96\% IoU scores. Besides, our model performance improved to Dice score 61.78\% and IoU score 43.00\% on whole mammographs in private dataset using SAM-augmented input images.},

title = "Development of a Waste Collection Robot for Train Carriages Interior",
abstract = "In response to the increasing demand for quicker and less expensive train carriage cleaning, this project focuses on developing an autonomous robotic system for waste collection within train carriages. While numerous robots have been designed to clean the exteriors of trains, significantly fewer solutions exist for cleaning interior spaces. To address the unique challenges of detecting common waste items and reaching at the confined spaces of train interiors for collection, the paper proposes a novel proof-of-concept robotic system, designed to identify and collect waste items from the train floor surface, such as cans and plastic bottles from confined spaces, using an on-board waste collection and storage unit for proper disposal. The core focus of the project was to develop a waste detection algorithm for real-time object detection on low-power devices that navigate the robot, and to develop a waste collection mechanism that is durable and compact enough to be integrated onto a wheeled robot in order to gather the waste items. An NVIDIA Jetson Nano is used for detecting waste items using the SSD MobileNet v2 model (Single Shot MultiBox Detector) trained through the Jetson Inference project. The image-based waste detection is used to navigate the robot towards the waste item. A waste collection mechanism comprising of two parallel lines of revolving brushes is designed to collect waste and transport it to the onboard bin. This integrated system was evaluated to measure its performance in detecting and collecting waste items under a train seat. The results demonstrate the ability of this integrated system, to navigate towards the detected waste item and collect it from under the seat. Thus, showcasing its potential as an initial step towards creating an autonomous mobile robotic platform for waste collection in public transportation environments.",
